# Generalized Learning Algorithm
## for Humans

## Premise

All human skills are exactly one step away from a collection of other skills.

With this idea in mind it is possible (with your help) to catalog all human skills and work
backwards to find an optimal path to reach any particular skill set.

## Usage

Add me later after we have something.
